It helps achieve SDG Goal 9 \:\'Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure\' as it can unleash competitive economic forces and generate employment. Also, it contributes to attain SDG Goal 11: \“Sustainable Cities and Communities\" by not only creating career and business opportunities but improving urban planning and management in participatory ways. Other SDGs like Clean Water and Sanitation make implicit the need for a solid infrastructure as well.', 'Why PPP?':'Out of many infrastructure projects, SDP focuses on Public Private Partnership (PPP). This is due to the efficiency of PPP in building infrastructure.  Infrastructure projects require a great amount of capital, which is usually a heavy burden for governments in developing countries. PPP can allow for better procurement of funding from the private sectors which makes many infrastructure projects more achievable. Also, utilizing private sector technology and innovation provides better public services with improved efficiency. Meanwhile, the government\'s overall involvement in the project keeps the private sector in check so that the project not only seeks profit but is beneficial for society and in line with the SDGs'}
